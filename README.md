# Iot-Based-Solar-Monitoring-System-Project-
🌞 IoT Based Solar Monitoring System (Arduino UNO)
📌 Project Description

This project is an IoT-enabled Solar Monitoring System built using an Arduino UNO. The system monitors the voltage, current, power, and temperature of a solar panel in real-time. The data is transmitted via an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to a cloud platform (ThingSpeak / Blynk / Firebase) for remote monitoring and analysis.

The system provides a smart way to track solar energy efficiency and detect faults, supporting sustainable energy management.

⚙️ Features

📡 IoT Connectivity – Uses ESP8266 (Wi-Fi module) with Arduino UNO.

⚡ Real-Time Monitoring – Voltage, current, power, and panel temperature.

📊 Cloud Visualization – Live graphs on ThingSpeak / Blynk app.

🔔 Alerts – Fault detection if panel output is below threshold.

🌍 Remote Access – Monitor panel performance from anywhere.

🛠️ Components Used

➤ Arduino UNO (ATmega328P) – main controller.

➤ ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module – for IoT connectivity.

➤ Voltage Sensor – for solar panel output voltage.

➤ Current Sensor (ACS712 / INA219) – for current measurement.

➤ Temperature Sensor (LM35 / DHT11) – for panel temperature.

➤ Solar Panel (test unit).

➤ LCD Display (16x2 with I2C) – for local monitoring.
